```java

well we can use 3 different ways or even more to commit the files 

1st from the terminal - 
git add . 
git commit -m "some message"
git status -- for checking the status of the git branch 
git branch -- for the branch of the repo that we are working with 
git push origin -- for pushing the files into the repository 
```

```java

2nd from the vs code 
stage the files 
write the message ie commit message 
and 
commit 
and sync or you can do commit and push 
```

```java

3rd will be in case of intellij idea 

you can commit from there also 
just you have to use the inbuilt commit functionality or feature to commit to a branch 

```

```java
also you can use github desktop application to commmit lots of ways to commit 
just use whatever you like 
which comes to your mind at that point of time thats it 
```
